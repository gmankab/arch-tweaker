# arch tweaks

I wrote this script for myself so that with one command I could bring to the ideal the already well-tuned arch Flagship system, which can be downloaded here [archlinuxgui.in/download.html](https://archlinuxgui.in/download.html)

run all tweaks:

```bash
sh <(curl -sSL gmanka.tk/arch)
```
